# Assignment for Data Processing for Python

For dis assignment, we go ask you make you explain di code wey we don start to dey develop for our challenges. Di assignment get two parts:

## COVID-19 Spread Modelling

 - [ ] Draw *R<sub>t</sub>* graph for 5-6 different countries for one graph to compare dem, or use plenty graphs side-by-side.
 - [ ] Check how di number of deaths and recoveries take relate with di number of infected cases.
 - [ ] Find out how long di disease dey last normally by looking di infection rate and death rate together and check for any strange thing. You fit need to check different countries to see am.
 - [ ] Calculate di fatality rate and how e dey change over time. *You fit wan consider how many days di disease dey last to shift one time series before you do di calculation.*

## COVID-19 Papers Analysis

- [ ] Build co-occurrence matrix of different medications, and check which medications dey show together (like dem mention am for one abstract). You fit adjust di code for building co-occurrence matrix for medications and diagnoses.
- [ ] Show dis matrix as heatmap.
- [ ] If you wan try extra, show di co-occurrence of medications using [chord diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_diagram). [Dis library](https://pypi.org/project/chord/) fit help you draw chord diagram.
- [ ] If you wan try another extra, extract di dosages of different medications (like **400mg** for *take 400mg of chloroquine daily*) using regular expressions, and build dataframe wey go show different dosages for different medications. **Note**: make you consider numbers wey dey near di medicine name for text.

## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement
--- | --- | -- |
All di tasks complete, graphically show and explain, including at least one of di two extra goals | More than 5 tasks complete, no extra goals dey try, or di results no clear | Less than 5 (but more than 3) tasks complete, di graphs no help to show di point
