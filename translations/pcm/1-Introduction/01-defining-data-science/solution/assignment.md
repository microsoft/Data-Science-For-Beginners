# Assignment: Data Science Scenarios

For dis first assignment, we wan make you think about some real-life process or problem for different problem area, and how you fit take Data Science process improve am. Think about dis:

1. Which data you fit collect?
1. How you go collect am?
1. How you go store di data? How big di data fit be?
1. Which insight you fit get from di data? Which decision we fit take based on di data?

Try think about 3 different problems/processes and describe each of di points wey dey above for each problem area.

Here be some problem area and problems wey fit help you start to think:

1. How you fit use data take improve di education process for pikin dem for school?
1. How you fit use data take control vaccination during di pandemic?
1. How you fit use data take make sure say you dey productive for work?

## Instructions

Fill di table wey dey below (if you wan change di suggested problem area to your own, you fit do am):

| Problem Domain | Problem | Which data to collect | How to store the data | Which insights/decisions we can make | 
|----------------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Education | For university, we dey see say lecture attendance dey low, and we get di hypothesis say students wey dey attend lectures well dey do better for exams. We wan encourage attendance and test di hypothesis. | We fit track attendance through pictures wey security camera dey take for class, or by tracking bluetooth/wifi addresses of student mobile phones for class. Exam data dey already for di university database. | If we dey track security camera images - we go need store some (5-10) pictures during class (unstructured data), and then use AI to identify di faces of students (convert di data to structured form). | We fit calculate average attendance data for each student, and check if e get any correlation with exam grades. We go talk more about correlation for [probability and statistics](../../04-stats-and-probability/README.md) section. To encourage student attendance, we fit publish di weekly attendance rating for school portal, and do raffle draw among di students wey get di highest attendance. |
| Vaccination | | | | |
| Productivity | | | | |

> *We don provide just one answer as example, so you fit get idea of wetin we dey expect for dis assignment.*

## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement
--- | --- | -- |
Person fit identify correct data sources, ways to store data and possible decisions/insights for all problem area | Some parts of di solution no dey detailed, data storage no dey discussed, at least 2 problem area dey described | Only some parts of di data solution dey described, only one problem area dey considered.
