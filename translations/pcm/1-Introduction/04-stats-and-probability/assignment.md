# Small Diabetes Study

For dis assignment, we go work wit one small dataset of diabetes patients wey dem collect from [here](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~boos/var.select/diabetes.html).

|   | AGE | SEX | BMI | BP | S1 | S2 | S3 | S4 | S5 | S6 | Y  |
|---|-----|-----|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | 59 | 2 | 32.1 | 101. | 157 | 93.2 | 38.0 | 4. | 4.8598 | 87 | 151 |
| 1 | 48 | 1 | 21.6 | 87.0 | 183 | 103.2 | 70. | 3. | 3.8918 | 69 | 75 |
| 2 | 72 | 2 | 30.5 | 93.0 | 156 | 93.6 | 41.0 | 4.0 | 4. | 85 | 141 |
