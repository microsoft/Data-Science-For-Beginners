## For Educators

You wan use dis curriculum for your classroom? Abeg feel free!

To do am, fork dis repo. You go need create repo for each lesson, so you go need to separate each folder into different repo. Like dat, [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms) fit pick each lesson one by one.

Dis [full instructions](https://github.blog/2020-03-18-set-up-your-digital-classroom-with-github-classroom/) go show you how you fit set up your classroom.

## Using the repo as e dey

If you wan use dis repo as e dey now, without GitHub Classroom, e still dey possible. You go need tell your students which lesson dem go work on together.

For online format (Zoom, Teams, or any other), you fit create breakout rooms for the quizzes, and mentor students to help dem prepare to learn. Then you fit invite students to do the quizzes and submit their answers as 'issues' for one particular time. You fit do the same thing for assignments, if you wan make students work together openly.

If you prefer private format, tell your students to fork the curriculum, lesson by lesson, to their own GitHub repos as private repos, and give you access. Then dem fit complete quizzes and assignments privately and submit am to you through issues for your classroom repo.
