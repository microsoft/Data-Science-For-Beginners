# Low code/No code Data Science project for Azure ML

## Instructions

We don see how to use Azure ML platform take train, deploy and use model for Low code/No code way. Now make you find some data wey you fit use train another model, deploy am and use am. You fit find datasets for [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) and [Azure Open Datasets](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/open-datasets/catalog?WT.mc_id=academic-77958-bethanycheum&ocid=AID3041109).

## Rubric

| Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
|When you dey upload the data, you make sure say you change the feature type if e need am. You also clean the data if e need am. You run training for dataset through AutoML, and you check the model explanations. You deploy the best model and you fit use am. | When you dey upload the data, you make sure say you change the feature type if e need am. You run training for dataset through AutoML, you deploy the best model and you fit use am. | You don deploy the best model wey AutoML train and you fit use am. |
