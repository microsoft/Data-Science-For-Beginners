# Data Science project using Azure ML SDK

## Instructions

We explored how to use the Azure ML platform to train, deploy, and consume a model with the Azure ML SDK. Now, find some data that you can use to train another model, deploy it, and consume it. You can search for datasets on [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) and [Azure Open Datasets](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/open-datasets/catalog?WT.mc_id=academic-77958-bethanycheum&ocid=AID3041109).

## Rubric

| Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
|When configuring AutoML, you referred to the SDK documentation to explore the parameters you could use. You trained a dataset using AutoML with the Azure ML SDK, reviewed the model explanations, deployed the best model, and successfully consumed it using the Azure ML SDK. | You trained a dataset using AutoML with the Azure ML SDK, reviewed the model explanations, deployed the best model, and successfully consumed it using the Azure ML SDK. | You trained a dataset using AutoML with the Azure ML SDK, deployed the best model, and successfully consumed it using the Azure ML SDK. |
