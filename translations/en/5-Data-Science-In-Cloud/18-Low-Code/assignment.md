# Low code/No code Data Science project on Azure ML

## Instructions

We explored how to use the Azure ML platform to train, deploy, and consume a model in a Low code/No code manner. Now, find some data that you can use to train another model, deploy it, and consume it. You can search for datasets on [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) and [Azure Open Datasets](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/open-datasets/catalog?WT.mc_id=academic-77958-bethanycheum&ocid=AID3041109).

## Rubric

| Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
|When uploading the data, you ensured to change the feature's type if necessary. You also cleaned the data if needed. You trained a model on a dataset using AutoML, and you reviewed the model explanations. You deployed the best model and successfully consumed it. | When uploading the data, you ensured to change the feature's type if necessary. You trained a model on a dataset using AutoML, deployed the best model, and successfully consumed it. | You deployed the best model trained by AutoML and successfully consumed it. |
