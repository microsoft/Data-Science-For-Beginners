When working with big data in data science, the cloud can be a game changer. In the next three lessons, we will explore what the cloud is and why it can be incredibly useful. We will also analyze a heart failure dataset and build a model to estimate the likelihood of someone experiencing heart failure. Using the cloud's capabilities, we will train, deploy, and utilize the model in two different ways: one using only the user interface in a Low code/No code approach, and the other using the Azure Machine Learning Software Developer Kit (Azure ML SDK).
