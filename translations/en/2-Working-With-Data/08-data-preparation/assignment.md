# Evaluating Data from a Form

A client has been testing a [small form](../../../../2-Working-With-Data/08-data-preparation/index.html) to collect some basic information about their customer base. They have shared their findings with you to validate the data they have gathered. You can open the `index.html` page in your browser to review the form.

You have been provided with a [dataset of csv records](../../../../data/form.csv) containing entries from the form, along with some basic visualizations. The client has noted that some of the visualizations appear incorrect, but they are unsure how to fix them. You can explore this further in the [assignment notebook](../../../../2-Working-With-Data/08-data-preparation/assignment.ipynb).

## Instructions

Use the techniques covered in this lesson to provide recommendations for improving the form so that it collects accurate and consistent information.
