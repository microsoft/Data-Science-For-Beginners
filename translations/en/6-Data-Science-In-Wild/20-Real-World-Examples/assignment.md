# Explore a Planetary Computer Dataset

## Instructions

In this lesson, we discussed various domains of data science applications, diving deeper into examples related to research, sustainability, and digital humanities. In this assignment, you'll explore one of these examples in greater detail and apply your knowledge of data visualizations and analysis to extract insights about sustainability data.

The [Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/) project offers datasets and APIs that can be accessed with an account—request one if you'd like to try the bonus step of the assignment. The site also includes an [Explorer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/explore) feature that you can use without needing to create an account.

`Steps:`  
The Explorer interface (shown in the screenshot below) allows you to select a dataset (from the available options), a preset query (to filter the data), and a rendering option (to generate a relevant visualization). For this assignment, your task is to:

1. Read the [Explorer documentation](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/docs/overview/explorer/) to understand the available options.  
2. Explore the dataset [Catalog](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/catalog) to learn the purpose of each dataset.  
3. Use the Explorer to choose a dataset of interest, select a relevant query, and pick a rendering option.

`Your Task:`  
Once you've studied the visualization rendered in the browser, answer the following questions:  
* What _features_ does the dataset include?  
* What _insights_ or results does the visualization reveal?  
* What are the _implications_ of those insights for the sustainability goals of the project?  
* What are the _limitations_ of the visualization (i.e., what insights were not provided)?  
* If you had access to the raw data, what _alternative visualizations_ would you create, and why?  

`Bonus Points:`  
Apply for an account and log in once accepted.  
* Use the _Launch Hub_ option to open the raw data in a Notebook.  
* Explore the data interactively and implement the alternative visualizations you envisioned.  
* Analyze your custom visualizations—were you able to uncover the insights you missed earlier?  

## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement  
--- | --- | ---  
All five core questions were answered. The student clearly identified how current and alternative visualizations could provide insights into sustainability objectives or outcomes. | The student answered at least the top three questions in detail, demonstrating practical experience with the Explorer. | The student failed to answer multiple questions or provided insufficient detail, indicating that no meaningful attempt was made for the project.
