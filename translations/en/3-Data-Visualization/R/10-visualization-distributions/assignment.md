## Instructions

Up to this point, youâ€™ve worked with the Minnesota birds dataset to uncover insights about bird counts and population density. Now, put these techniques into practice by exploring a different dataset, perhaps one from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Create an R script that tells a story about this dataset, and be sure to incorporate histograms in your analysis.

## Rubric

--- | --- | --- |
A script is provided with detailed annotations about the dataset, including its source, and utilizes at least 5 histograms to extract meaningful insights from the data. | A script is provided with incomplete annotations or contains errors. | A script is provided without annotations and includes errors.
