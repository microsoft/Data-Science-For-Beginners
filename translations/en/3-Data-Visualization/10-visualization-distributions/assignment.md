## Instructions

Up to this point, you have worked with the Minnesota birds dataset to uncover information about bird numbers and population density. Now, practice applying these techniques by exploring a different dataset, perhaps one from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Create a notebook that tells a story about this dataset, and be sure to include histograms in your analysis.

--- | --- | --- |
A notebook is provided with annotations about the dataset, including its source, and uses at least 5 histograms to uncover insights about the data. | A notebook is provided with incomplete annotations or contains errors. | A notebook is provided without annotations and contains errors.
