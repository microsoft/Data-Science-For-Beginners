Visualizing data is one of the most essential tasks for a data scientist. A picture is worth a thousand words, and a visualization can help you uncover various interesting aspects of your data, such as spikes, anomalies, clusters, trends, and more, enabling you to understand the story your data is telling.

In these five lessons, you will work with data sourced from nature and create engaging and visually appealing visualizations using different techniques.

üçØ Data on US Honey Production is sourced from Jessica Li's project on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/honey-production). The [data](https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/rn301137d) originates from the [United States Department of Agriculture](https://www.nass.usda.gov/About_NASS/index.php).

üçÑ Data on mushrooms is also sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hatterasdunton/mushroom-classification-updated-dataset), revised by Hatteras Dunton. This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family. The mushrooms are drawn from *The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms* (1981). This dataset was donated to UCI ML 27 in 1987.

ü¶Ü Data on Minnesota Birds is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hannahcollins/minnesota-birds), scraped from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_birds_of_Minnesota) by Hannah Collins.
