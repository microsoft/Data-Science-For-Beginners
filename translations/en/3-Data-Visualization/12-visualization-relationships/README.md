Continuing with the nature focus of our research, let's explore fascinating ways to visualize the relationships between different types of honey, based on a dataset from the [United States Department of Agriculture](https://www.nass.usda.gov/About_NASS/index.php).

This dataset, containing around 600 entries, showcases honey production across various U.S. states. For instance, you can examine the number of colonies, yield per colony, total production, stocks, price per pound, and the value of honey produced in a specific state from 1998 to 2012, with one row per year for each state.

It would be intriguing to visualize the relationship between a state's annual production and, for example, the price of honey in that state. Alternatively, you could explore the relationship between honey yield per colony across states. This time period includes the emergence of the devastating 'CCD' or 'Colony Collapse Disorder' first identified in 2006 (http://npic.orst.edu/envir/ccd.html), making this dataset particularly significant to study. 🐝

## [Pre-lecture quiz](https://ff-quizzes.netlify.app/en/ds/quiz/22)

In this lesson, you'll use Seaborn, a library you've worked with before, to effectively visualize relationships between variables. One particularly useful function in Seaborn is `relplot`, which enables scatter plots and line plots to quickly illustrate '[statistical relationships](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/relational.html?highlight=relationships)', helping data scientists better understand how variables interact.

## Scatterplots

Use a scatterplot to show how the price of honey has changed year over year, for each state. Seaborn's `relplot` conveniently organizes state data and displays data points for both categorical and numeric data.

Let's begin by importing the data and Seaborn:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
honey = pd.read_csv('../../data/honey.csv')
honey.head()
```
You'll notice that the honey dataset includes several interesting columns, such as year and price per pound. Let's examine this data, grouped by U.S. state:

| state | numcol | yieldpercol | totalprod | stocks   | priceperlb | prodvalue | year |
| ----- | ------ | ----------- | --------- | -------- | ---------- | --------- | ---- |
| AL    | 16000  | 71          | 1136000   | 159000   | 0.72       | 818000    | 1998 |
| AZ    | 55000  | 60          | 3300000   | 1485000  | 0.64       | 2112000   | 1998 |
| AR    | 53000  | 65          | 3445000   | 1688000  | 0.59       | 2033000   | 1998 |
| CA    | 450000 | 83          | 37350000  | 12326000 | 0.62       | 23157000  | 1998 |
| CO    | 27000  | 72          | 1944000   | 1594000  | 0.7        | 1361000   | 1998 |

Create a basic scatterplot to show the relationship between the price per pound of honey and its U.S. state of origin. Adjust the `y` axis to ensure all states are visible:

```python
sns.relplot(x="priceperlb", y="state", data=honey, height=15, aspect=.5);
```
![scatterplot 1](../../../../translated_images/scatter1.5e1aa5fd6706c5d12b5e503ccb77f8a930f8620f539f524ddf56a16c039a5d2f.en.png)

Next, use a honey-inspired color scheme to illustrate how the price evolves over the years. Add a 'hue' parameter to highlight year-over-year changes:

```python
sns.relplot(x="priceperlb", y="state", hue="year", palette="YlOrBr", data=honey, height=15, aspect=.5);
```
![scatterplot 2](../../../../translated_images/scatter2.c0041a58621ca702990b001aa0b20cd68c1e1814417139af8a7211a2bed51c5f.en.png)

With this color scheme, you can clearly see a strong upward trend in honey prices over the years. If you examine a specific state, such as Arizona, you can observe a consistent pattern of price increases year over year, with only a few exceptions:

| state | numcol | yieldpercol | totalprod | stocks  | priceperlb | prodvalue | year |
| ----- | ------ | ----------- | --------- | ------- | ---------- | --------- | ---- |
| AZ    | 55000  | 60          | 3300000   | 1485000 | 0.64       | 2112000   | 1998 |
| AZ    | 52000  | 62          | 3224000   | 1548000 | 0.62       | 1999000   | 1999 |
| AZ    | 40000  | 59          | 2360000   | 1322000 | 0.73       | 1723000   | 2000 |
| AZ    | 43000  | 59          | 2537000   | 1142000 | 0.72       | 1827000   | 2001 |
| AZ    | 38000  | 63          | 2394000   | 1197000 | 1.08       | 2586000   | 2002 |
| AZ    | 35000  | 72          | 2520000   | 983000  | 1.34       | 3377000   | 2003 |
| AZ    | 32000  | 55          | 1760000   | 774000  | 1.11       | 1954000   | 2004 |
| AZ    | 36000  | 50          | 1800000   | 720000  | 1.04       | 1872000   | 2005 |
| AZ    | 30000  | 65          | 1950000   | 839000  | 0.91       | 1775000   | 2006 |
| AZ    | 30000  | 64          | 1920000   | 902000  | 1.26       | 2419000   | 2007 |
| AZ    | 25000  | 64          | 1600000   | 336000  | 1.26       | 2016000   | 2008 |
| AZ    | 20000  | 52          | 1040000   | 562000  | 1.45       | 1508000   | 2009 |
| AZ    | 24000  | 77          | 1848000   | 665000  | 1.52       | 2809000   | 2010 |
| AZ    | 23000  | 53          | 1219000   | 427000  | 1.55       | 1889000   | 2011 |
| AZ    | 22000  | 46          | 1012000   | 253000  | 1.79       | 1811000   | 2012 |

Another way to visualize this trend is by using size instead of color. For colorblind users, this might be a better option. Modify your visualization to represent price increases with larger dot sizes:

```python
sns.relplot(x="priceperlb", y="state", size="year", data=honey, height=15, aspect=.5);
```
You can observe the dots growing larger over time.

![scatterplot 3](../../../../translated_images/scatter3.3c160a3d1dcb36b37900ebb4cf97f34036f28ae2b7b8e6062766c7c1dfc00853.en.png)

Is this simply a case of supply and demand? Could factors like climate change and colony collapse be reducing the availability of honey year over year, leading to price increases?

To investigate correlations between variables in this dataset, let's explore some line charts.

## Line charts

Question: Is there a clear upward trend in honey prices per pound year over year? The simplest way to find out is by creating a single line chart:

```python
sns.relplot(x="year", y="priceperlb", kind="line", data=honey);
```
Answer: Yes, although there are some exceptions around 2003:

![line chart 1](../../../../translated_images/line1.f36eb465229a3b1fe385cdc93861aab3939de987d504b05de0b6cd567ef79f43.en.png)

✅ Seaborn aggregates data into one line, displaying "multiple measurements at each x value by plotting the mean and the 95% confidence interval around the mean." [Source](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/relational.html). You can disable this time-consuming behavior by adding `ci=None`.

Question: In 2003, was there also a spike in honey supply? What happens if you examine total production year over year?

```python
sns.relplot(x="year", y="totalprod", kind="line", data=honey);
```

![line chart 2](../../../../translated_images/line2.a5b3493dc01058af6402e657aaa9ae1125fafb5e7d6630c777aa60f900a544e4.en.png)

Answer: Not really. Total production seems to have increased in 2003, even though overall honey production has been declining during these years.

Question: In that case, what might have caused the spike in honey prices around 2003?

To investigate further, let's use a facet grid.

## Facet grids

Facet grids allow you to focus on one aspect of your dataset (e.g., 'year') and create a plot for each facet of your chosen x and y coordinates, making comparisons easier. Does 2003 stand out in this type of visualization?

Create a facet grid using `relplot`, as recommended by [Seaborn's documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.FacetGrid.html?highlight=facetgrid#seaborn.FacetGrid).

```python
sns.relplot(
    data=honey, 
    x="yieldpercol", y="numcol",
    col="year", 
    col_wrap=3,
    kind="line"
```
In this visualization, compare yield per colony and number of colonies year over year, with columns wrapped at 3:

![facet grid](../../../../translated_images/facet.6a34851dcd540050dcc0ead741be35075d776741668dd0e42f482c89b114c217.en.png)

For this dataset, nothing particularly stands out regarding the number of colonies and their yield year over year or state over state. Is there another way to explore correlations between these variables?

## Dual-line Plots

Try a multiline plot by overlaying two line plots, using Seaborn's 'despine' to remove the top and right spines, and `ax.twinx` [from Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.twinx.html). Twinx allows a chart to share the x-axis while displaying two y-axes. Display yield per colony and number of colonies, superimposed:

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,6))
lineplot = sns.lineplot(x=honey['year'], y=honey['numcol'], data=honey, 
                        label = 'Number of bee colonies', legend=False)
sns.despine()
plt.ylabel('# colonies')
plt.title('Honey Production Year over Year');

ax2 = ax.twinx()
lineplot2 = sns.lineplot(x=honey['year'], y=honey['yieldpercol'], ax=ax2, color="r", 
                         label ='Yield per colony', legend=False) 
sns.despine(right=False)
plt.ylabel('colony yield')
ax.figure.legend();
```
![superimposed plots](../../../../translated_images/dual-line.a4c28ce659603fab2c003f4df816733df2bf41d1facb7de27989ec9afbf01b33.en.png)

While nothing particularly stands out around 2003, this visualization ends the lesson on a slightly positive note: although the number of colonies is declining overall, it appears to be stabilizing, even if their yield per colony is decreasing.

Go, bees, go!
