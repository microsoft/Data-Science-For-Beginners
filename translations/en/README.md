We have a Discord learn with AI series ongoing, learn more and join us at [Learn with AI Series](https://aka.ms/learnwithai/discord) from 18 - 30 September, 2025. You will get tips and tricks of using GitHub Copilot for Data Science.

![Learn with AI series](../../translated_images/1.2b28cdc6205e26fef6a21817fe5d83ae8b50fbd0a33e9fed0df05845da5b30b6.en.jpg)

# Are you a student?

Get started with the following resources:

- [Student Hub page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/student-hub?WT.mc_id=academic-77958-bethanycheum) In this page, you will find beginner resources, Student packs and even ways to get a free cert voucher. This is one page you want to bookmark and check from time to time as we switch out content at least monthly.
- [Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com?WT.mc_id=academic-77958-bethanycheum) Join a global community of student ambassadors, this could be your way into Microsoft.

# Getting Started

## 📚 Documentation

- **[Installation Guide](INSTALLATION.md)** - Step-by-step setup instructions for beginners
- **[Usage Guide](USAGE.md)** - Examples and common workflows
- **[Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)** - Solutions to common issues
- **[Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)** - How to contribute to this project
- **[For Teachers](for-teachers.md)** - Teaching guidance and classroom resources

## 👨‍🎓 For Students
> **Complete Beginners**: New to data science? Start with our [beginner-friendly examples](examples/README.md)! These simple, well-commented examples will help you understand the basics before diving into the full curriculum.
> **[Students](https://aka.ms/student-page)**: to use this curriculum on your own, fork the entire repo and complete the exercises on your own, starting with a pre-lecture quiz.  Then read the lecture and complete the rest of the activities. Try to create the projects by comprehending the lessons rather than copying the solution code; however, that code is available in the /solutions folders in each project-oriented lesson. Another idea would be to form a study group with friends and go through the content together. For further study, we recommend [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/users/jenlooper-2911/collections/qprpajyoy3x0g7?WT.mc_id=academic-77958-bethanycheum).

**Quick Start:**
1. Check the [Installation Guide](INSTALLATION.md) to set up your environment
2. Review the [Usage Guide](USAGE.md) to learn how to work with the curriculum
3. Start with Lesson 1 and work through sequentially
4. Join our [Discord community](https://aka.ms/ds4beginners/discord) for support

## 👩‍🏫 For Teachers

> **Teachers**: we have [included some suggestions](for-teachers.md) on how to use this curriculum.  We'd love your feedback [in our discussion forum](https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Science-For-Beginners/discussions)!

## Pedagogy

We have chosen two pedagogical tenets while building this curriculum: ensuring that it is project-based and that it includes frequent quizzes. By the end of this series, students will have learned basic principles of data science, including ethical concepts, data preparation, different ways of working with data, data visualization, data analysis, real-world use cases of data science, and more.

In addition, a low-stakes quiz before a class sets the intention of the student towards learning a topic, while a second quiz after class ensures further retention. This curriculum was designed to be flexible and fun and can be taken in whole or in part. The projects start small and become increasingly complex by the end of the 10 week cycle.

> Find our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md),  [Translation](TRANSLATIONS.md) guidelines. We welcome your constructive feedback!

## Each lesson includes:

- Optional sketchnote
- Optional supplemental video
- Pre-lesson warmup quiz
- Written lesson
- For project-based lessons, step-by-step guides on how to build the project
- Knowledge checks
- A challenge
- Supplemental reading
- Assignment
- [Post-lesson quiz](https://ff-quizzes.netlify.app/en/)

> **A note about quizzes**: All quizzes are contained in the Quiz-App folder, for 40 total quizzes of three questions each. They are linked from within the lessons, but the quiz app can be run locally or deployed to Azure; follow the instruction in the `quiz-app` folder. They are gradually being localized.

## 🎓 Beginner-Friendly Examples

**New to Data Science?** We've created a special [examples directory](examples/README.md) with simple, well-commented code to help you get started:

- 🌟 **Hello World** - Your first data science program
- 📂 **Loading Data** - Learn to read and explore datasets
- 📊 **Simple Analysis** - Calculate statistics and find patterns
- 📈 **Basic Visualization** - Create charts and graphs
- 🔬 **Real-World Project** - Complete workflow from start to finish

Each example includes detailed comments explaining every step, making it perfect for absolute beginners!

## GitHub Codespaces

Follow these steps to open this sample in a Codespace:
1. Click the Code drop-down menu and select the Open with Codespaces option.
2. Select + New codespace at the bottom on the pane.
For more info, check out the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository#creating-a-codespace).

## VSCode Remote - Containers
Follow these steps to open this repo in a container using your local machine and VSCode using  the VS Code Remote - Containers extension:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please ensure your system meets the pre-reqs (i.e. have Docker installed) in [the getting started documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_getting-started).

To use this repository, you can either open the repository in an isolated Docker volume:

**Note**: Under the hood, this will use the Remote-Containers: **Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command to clone the source code in a Docker volume instead of the local filesystem. [Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) are the preferred mechanism for persisting container data.

Or open a locally cloned or downloaded version of the repository:

- Clone this repository to your local filesystem.
- Press F1 and select the **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command.
- Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and try things out.

## Offline access

You can run this documentation offline by using [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/). Fork this repo, [install Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart) on your local machine,  then in the root folder of this repo, type `docsify serve`. The website will be served on port 3000 on your localhost: `localhost:3000`.

> Note, notebooks will not be rendered via Docsify, so when you need to run a notebook, do that separately in VS Code running a Python kernel.
