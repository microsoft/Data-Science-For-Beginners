# Data Science for Beginners - A Curriculum

Azure Cloud Advocates at Microsoft are excited to present a 10-week, 20-lesson curriculum focused on Data Science. Each lesson includes pre-lesson and post-lesson quizzes, detailed instructions, solutions, and assignments. This project-based approach helps you learn effectively by building, ensuring new skills are retained.

[![Azure AI Discord](https://dcbadge.limes.pink/api/server/kzRShWzttr)](https://aka.ms/ds4beginners/discord)

We have a Discord Learn with AI series ongoing. Learn more and join us at [Learn with AI Series](https://aka.ms/learnwithai/discord) from September 18 - 30, 2025. You'll get tips and tricks for using GitHub Copilot for Data Science.

# Are you a student?

Get started with these resources:

- [Student Hub page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/student-hub?WT.mc_id=academic-77958-bethanycheum): This page offers beginner resources, student packs, and even ways to get a free certification voucher. Bookmark this page and check back regularly as content is updated monthly.
- [Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com?WT.mc_id=academic-77958-bethanycheum): Join a global community of student ambassadors—this could be your gateway into Microsoft.

# Getting Started

> **Teachers**: We have [included some suggestions](for-teachers.md) on how to use this curriculum. We'd love your feedback [in our discussion forum](https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Science-For-Beginners/discussions)!

> **[Students](https://aka.ms/student-page)**: To use this curriculum independently, fork the entire repository and complete the exercises on your own, starting with a pre-lesson quiz. Then, read the lesson and complete the activities. Try to build the projects by understanding the lessons rather than copying the solution code (though the solution code is available in the /solutions folders for each project-based lesson). Another idea is to form a study group with friends and go through the content together. For further study, we recommend [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/users/jenlooper-2911/collections/qprpajyoy3x0g7?WT.mc_id=academic-77958-bethanycheum).

## Pedagogy

This curriculum is built on two key principles: project-based learning and frequent quizzes. By the end of this series, students will have learned fundamental concepts of data science, including ethical considerations, data preparation, various methods of working with data, data visualization, data analysis, real-world applications of data science, and more.

Additionally, a low-stakes quiz before a class helps set the student's focus on the topic, while a post-class quiz reinforces retention. This curriculum is designed to be flexible and enjoyable, allowing students to take it in full or in part. The projects start small and gradually become more complex over the 10-week cycle.

> Check out our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md), and [Translation](TRANSLATIONS.md) guidelines. We welcome your constructive feedback!

## Each lesson includes:

- Optional sketchnote
- Optional supplemental video
- Pre-lesson warmup quiz
- Written lesson
- For project-based lessons, step-by-step guides on how to build the project
- Knowledge checks
- A challenge
- Supplemental reading
- Assignment
- [Post-lesson quiz](https://ff-quizzes.netlify.app/en/)

> **A note about quizzes**: All quizzes are contained in the Quiz-App folder, with 40 quizzes of three questions each. They are linked within the lessons, but the quiz app can be run locally or deployed to Azure; follow the instructions in the `quiz-app` folder. Localization is ongoing.

## GitHub Codespaces

Follow these steps to open this sample in a Codespace:
1. Click the Code drop-down menu and select the Open with Codespaces option.
2. Select + New codespace at the bottom of the pane.
For more info, check out the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository#creating-a-codespace).

## VSCode Remote - Containers
Follow these steps to open this repo in a container using your local machine and VSCode with the VS Code Remote - Containers extension:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, ensure your system meets the prerequisites (e.g., Docker installed) as outlined in [the getting started documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_getting-started).

To use this repository, you can either open it in an isolated Docker volume:

**Note**: This will use the Remote-Containers: **Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command to clone the source code into a Docker volume instead of the local filesystem. [Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) are the preferred method for persisting container data.

Or open a locally cloned or downloaded version of the repository:

- Clone this repository to your local filesystem.
- Press F1 and select the **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command.
- Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and explore the content.

## Offline access

You can run this documentation offline using [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/). Fork this repo, [install Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart) on your local machine, and in the root folder of this repo, type `docsify serve`. The website will be served on port 3000 on your localhost: `localhost:3000`.

> Note: Notebooks will not be rendered via Docsify. To run a notebook, use VS Code with a Python kernel.
