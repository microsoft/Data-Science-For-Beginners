# Data Science for Beginners - A Curriculum

Azure Cloud Advocates at Microsoft are excited to present a 10-week, 20-lesson curriculum focused on Data Science. Each lesson includes pre-lesson and post-lesson quizzes, step-by-step instructions, solutions, and assignments. This project-based approach helps you learn by doing, ensuring the skills you gain are long-lasting.

# Getting Started

> **Teachers**: We've [included some suggestions](for-teachers.md) on how to use this curriculum. Share your feedback [in our discussion forum](https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Science-For-Beginners/discussions)!

> **[Students](https://aka.ms/student-page)**: To use this curriculum independently, fork the repository and complete the exercises, starting with the pre-lesson quiz. Then, read the lesson and complete the activities. Try to build the projects by understanding the lessons rather than copying the solution code (though solutions are available in the /solutions folders for each project-based lesson). Another option is to form a study group with friends and go through the content together. For further learning, we recommend [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/users/jenlooper-2911/collections/qprpajyoy3x0g7?WT.mc_id=academic-77958-bethanycheum).

## Pedagogy

This curriculum is built on two key principles: project-based learning and frequent quizzes. By the end of the series, students will understand fundamental concepts of data science, including ethical considerations, data preparation, working with data, data visualization, data analysis, real-world applications, and more.

Additionally, a low-pressure quiz before each class helps students focus on the topic, while a post-class quiz reinforces retention. The curriculum is designed to be flexible and enjoyable, allowing students to complete it in full or in part. Projects start small and gradually become more complex over the 10-week cycle.
Find our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md), [Translation](TRANSLATIONS.md) guidelines. We appreciate your constructive feedback!
## Each lesson includes:

- Optional sketchnote
- Optional supplemental video
- Pre-lesson warmup quiz
- Written lesson
- For project-based lessons, step-by-step guides on how to build the project
- Knowledge checks
- A challenge
- Supplemental reading
- Assignment
- [Post-lesson quiz](https://ff-quizzes.netlify.app/en/)

> **A note about quizzes**: All quizzes are located in the Quiz-App folder, with a total of 40 quizzes, each containing three questions. They are linked within the lessons, but the quiz app can also be run locally or deployed to Azure. Follow the instructions in the `quiz-app` folder. Localization is ongoing.

## GitHub Codespaces

Follow these steps to open this sample in a Codespace:
1. Click the Code drop-down menu and select the Open with Codespaces option.
2. Select + New codespace at the bottom on the pane.
For more info, check out the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository#creating-a-codespace).

## VSCode Remote - Containers
Follow these steps to open this repo in a container using your local machine and VSCode using  the VS Code Remote - Containers extension:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please ensure your system meets the pre-reqs (i.e. have Docker installed) in [the getting started documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_getting-started).

To use this repository, you can either open the repository in an isolated Docker volume:

**Note**: Under the hood, this will use the Remote-Containers: **Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command to clone the source code in a Docker volume instead of the local filesystem. [Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) are the preferred mechanism for persisting container data.

Or open a locally cloned or downloaded version of the repository:

- Clone this repository to your local filesystem.
- Press F1 and select the **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command.
- Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and try things out.

## Offline access

You can run this documentation offline by using [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/). Fork this repo, [install Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart) on your local machine,  then in the root folder of this repo, type `docsify serve`. The website will be served on port 3000 on your localhost: `localhost:3000`.

> Note, notebooks will not be rendered via Docsify, so when you need to run a notebook, do that separately in VS Code running a Python kernel.
