# Small Diabetes Study

In this assignment, we will work with a small dataset of diabetes patients taken from [here](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~boos/var.select/diabetes.html).

|   | AGE | SEX | BMI | BP | S1 | S2 | S3 | S4 | S5 | S6 | Y  |
|---|-----|-----|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | 59 | 2 | 32.1 | 101. | 157 | 93.2 | 38.0 | 4. | 4.8598 | 87 | 151 |
| 1 | 48 | 1 | 21.6 | 87.0 | 183 | 103.2 | 70. | 3. | 3.8918 | 69 | 75 |
| 2 | 72 | 2 | 30.5 | 93.0 | 156 | 93.6 | 41.0 | 4.0 | 4. | 85 | 141 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ...| ...| ...| ...| ...| ...| ...| ... |

## Instructions

* Open the [assignment notebook](../../../../1-Introduction/04-stats-and-probability/assignment.ipynb) in a Jupyter notebook environment
* Complete all tasks listed in the notebook, namely:
   * [ ] Calculate the mean values and variance for all variables
   * [ ] Create boxplots for BMI, BP, and Y based on gender
   * [ ] Analyze the distribution of Age, Sex, BMI, and Y variables
   * [ ] Examine the correlation between different variables and disease progression (Y)
   * [ ] Test the hypothesis that the progression of diabetes differs between men and women
   
## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement
--- | --- | -- |
All required tasks are completed, visually represented, and explained | Most tasks are completed, but explanations or insights from graphs and/or calculated values are missing | Only basic tasks like calculating mean/variance and creating simple plots are completed, with no conclusions drawn from the data
