# Assignment: Data Science Scenarios

In this first assignment, we ask you to think about some real-life processes or problems in different domains, and how you can improve them using the Data Science process. Consider the following:

1. What data can you collect?
1. How would you collect it?
1. How would you store the data? How large is the data likely to be?
1. What insights might you be able to derive from this data? What decisions could be made based on the data?

Try to think about 3 different problems/processes and describe each of the points above for each domain.

Here are some domains and problems to help you start thinking:

1. How can data be used to improve the education process for children in schools?
1. How can data be used to manage vaccination during a pandemic?
1. How can data be used to ensure productivity at work?

## Instructions

Fill in the following table (replace the suggested domains with your own if needed):

| Problem Domain | Problem | What data to collect | How to store the data | What insights/decisions we can make | 
|----------------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Education | | | | |
| Vaccination | | | | |
| Productivity | | | | |

## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement
--- | --- | -- |
The solution identifies reasonable data sources, methods of storing data, and possible decisions/insights for all domains | Some aspects of the solution lack detail, data storage is not discussed, at least 2 domains are described | Only parts of the data solution are described, only one domain is considered.
