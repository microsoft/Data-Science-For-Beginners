Of course, depending on the specific data, some steps might be skipped (e.g., if the data is already stored in a database or if model training isn't necessary), or some steps might be repeated multiple times (such as data processing).

## Digitalization and Digital Transformation

Over the past decade, many businesses have come to realize the importance of data in making informed decisions. To apply data science principles effectively in a business context, the first step is to collect relevant data‚Äîessentially converting business processes into digital formats. This process is referred to as **digitalization**. Leveraging data science techniques on this digitized data to inform decisions can lead to significant productivity gains or even a complete business pivot, a process known as **digital transformation**.

Let‚Äôs consider an example. Suppose we are delivering a data science course (like this one) online to students, and we want to use data science to improve it. How might we go about this?

We could start by asking, "What aspects can be digitized?" The simplest approach might involve measuring the time it takes each student to complete each module and assessing their knowledge through a multiple-choice test at the end of each module. By averaging the completion times across all students, we could identify which modules are the most challenging and focus on simplifying them.
You might argue that this method isn't perfect, as modules can vary in length. It would likely be more equitable to divide the time by the module's length (measured in the number of characters) and compare those results instead.
When analyzing the results of multiple-choice tests, we can identify concepts that students struggle to understand and use this information to improve the content. To achieve this, tests should be designed so that each question corresponds to a specific concept or piece of knowledge.

For a more advanced approach, we can compare the time taken to complete each module with the age group of the students. This might reveal that certain age groups take an unusually long time to finish the module or that students drop out before completing it. Such insights can help us recommend appropriate age groups for the module and reduce dissatisfaction caused by mismatched expectations.

## üöÄ Challenge

In this challenge, we will identify concepts related to the field of Data Science by analyzing texts. We'll use a Wikipedia article on Data Science, download and process the text, and then create a word cloud like this one:

![Word Cloud for Data Science](../../../../translated_images/ds_wordcloud.664a7c07dca57de017c22bf0498cb40f898d48aa85b3c36a80620fea12fadd42.en.png)

Check out [`notebook.ipynb`](../../../../../../../../../1-Introduction/01-defining-data-science/notebook.ipynb ':ignore') to explore the code. You can also run the code to see how it performs all data transformations in real time.
