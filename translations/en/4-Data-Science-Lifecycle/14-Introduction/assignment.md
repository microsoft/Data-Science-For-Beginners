# Assessing a Dataset

A client has reached out to your team for assistance in analyzing the seasonal spending habits of taxi customers in New York City.

They want to know: **Do yellow taxi passengers in New York City tip drivers more in the winter or summer?**

Your team is currently in the [Capturing](Readme.md#Capturing) phase of the Data Science Lifecycle, and you are responsible for managing the dataset. You have been provided with a notebook and [data](../../../../data/taxi.csv) to examine.

In this directory, there is a [notebook](../../../../4-Data-Science-Lifecycle/14-Introduction/notebook.ipynb) that uses Python to load yellow taxi trip data from the [NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/open-datasets/dataset-taxi-yellow?tabs=azureml-opendatasets).
You can also open the taxi data file using a text editor or spreadsheet software like Excel.

## Instructions

- Evaluate whether the data in this dataset is sufficient to answer the question.
- Explore the [NYC Open Data catalog](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?sortBy=most_accessed&utf8=%E2%9C%93). Identify an additional dataset that might be useful in addressing the client's question.
- Formulate 3 questions to ask the client for further clarification and a deeper understanding of the problem.

Refer to the [dataset's dictionary](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf) and [user guide](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/trip_record_user_guide.pdf) for more details about the data.
