# Exploring for answers

This is a continuation of the previous lesson's [assignment](../14-Introduction/assignment.md), where we briefly examined the dataset. Now, we will dive deeper into the data.

Once again, the question the client wants answered is: **Do yellow taxi passengers in New York City tip drivers more in the winter or summer?**

Your team is currently in the [Analyzing](README.md) stage of the Data Science Lifecycle, where you are tasked with performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset. You have been provided with a notebook and a dataset containing 200 taxi transactions from January and July 2019.

## Instructions

In this directory, you will find a [notebook](../../../../4-Data-Science-Lifecycle/15-analyzing/assignment.ipynb) and data from the [Taxi & Limousine Commission](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/open-datasets/dataset-taxi-yellow?tabs=azureml-opendatasets). For more details about the data, refer to the [dataset's dictionary](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf) and [user guide](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/trip_record_user_guide.pdf).

Use some of the techniques covered in this lesson to conduct your own EDA in the notebook (feel free to add cells if needed) and answer the following questions:

- What other factors in the data might influence the tip amount?
- Which columns are likely unnecessary for answering the client's question?
- Based on the data provided so far, does it appear to show any evidence of seasonal tipping patterns?
